## Environment Setup
To successfully connect to the databases locally you must first setup your environment variables.

To do so, please create two files in the root directory `.env.test` and `.env.development`.

The content of the files should look something like this
- For the development file `PGDATABASE=database_name_here`
- For the test file `PGDATABASE=database_name_here_test`
